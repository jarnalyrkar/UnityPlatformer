# UnityPlatformer

Just another 2D-platforming game made in Unity3D

## Getting Started

* Download the Build folder, and launch game.exe to try out the game.
  It is not by any means a finished game yet. There are no "quit game" button (unless you get killed by a frog), so just press Alt+F4 to quit.
* Controls:
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Action:</th>
		<th>Keyboard:</th>
		<th>Joystick:</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Jump:</td>
		<td>Z</td>
		<td>Button0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Shoot:</td>
		<td>X</td>
		<td>Button1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Left:</td>
		<td>Arrow-Left</td>
		<td>Left-Analog Left</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Right:</td>
		<td>Arrow-Right</td>
		<td>Left-Analog Right</td>
	</tr>
</table>
